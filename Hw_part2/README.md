For this section of homework 1, I was given the task to create a small text adventure game. 
With a strong passion for cars, and previous career as a mechanic, I took intrest in making
my game related to cars. Brainstorming for a good map, a rustic old abandoned junkyard 
came to my mind. The idea here is that the player is stranded in a phone booth where 
down a gravel path they see a junkyard. Connected to this junkyard is a main office 
and a garage. Now the player can search this area and find keys and fuel in order
to get a car running and drive away. What they are escaping from or where they are
going to is up to the player's interpretation (:
